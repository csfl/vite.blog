Hello world! Thanks for patiently waiting for this first post from Vite. Going forward, we will be regularly sharing development in our engineering and BD efforts.

## CAPITAL RAISING

In our private sale, we were fortunate to have received backing from a number of top crypto funds, such as BitMain, Node Capital, Link VC, and Genesis Capital. We appreciate their recognition of our values, strategic positioning, technology, and team.

## RECRUITING

At the moment, a key focus for us is to hire an excellent engineering and operations team. And as a public blockchain, we will be actively developing our ecological system globally, and will set up multiple locations of operation.

We are pleased to announce that Richard Yan, a leader with many years of Wall Street and Silicon Valley experiences, has join us as COO. Richard most recently led business development and then finance at a fintech startup named Scratch. Previously, he was Vice President of Two Sigma’s high-frequency platform and Business Innovation & Growth group. Prior to that, he was at Goldman Sachs for eight years as a structured product trading strategist. Richard graduated B.A. from Dartmouth College and MBA from New York University.

With his experience and connections, we look forward to expansion in international markets, recruiting of top overseas talents, development of the Vite ecosystem, and sourcing of key business partnerships.

On the engineering side, we have hired 16 engineers and product managers, with six already on-boarded. Our new hires come from companies such as Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba and other top Internet firms.

## ENGINEERING

Our engineering team has started doing technical research and system designs. So far, we have performed deep-dives of design and implementation of Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS and Nano, and written internal reports for each.

Also, we have made selection and design decisions regarding local storage, hash algorithms, address creation algos, serialization, and network protocols. We decided on golang as the language for the initial version of Vite.

## OTHER

Our new office space of 4500 square feet is currently undergoing renovation. The space will seat at least 40.

## VITE Tidbits

With every update, we will share a few bullets our readers may find interesting:

* Vite is pronounced Veeeeeet and it means “quick” in French.
* The Vite system is designed as a reactionary blockchain, with its main innovation being asynchronous architecture. In simpler terms, a synchronous design differs from an asynchronous one in that the former is a bit like telephone calls and the latter similar to emails. The asynchronous setup allows for more information processed within a shorter period of time, hence higher throughput.
* Also, here is an old post about our technology from our CEO.

Thanks for all your support, and until next time!
